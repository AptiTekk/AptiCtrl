Do not rename any of these files! Doing so after the changeSet has been applied will break liquibase!

Once a changeSet has been deployed to live servers, modifications to it will NOT be seen.
You must create a new changeSet, not modify past ones! Check the date before modifying a changeSet;
has a release been deployed since then? If so, make a NEW changeSet.
